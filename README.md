### Option Valuation Methods

The following repository's purpose is to estimate the value of options using various popular numerical methods:
1. Black Scholes Model
2. Binomial Tree
3. Quasi Monte Carlo Simulation
4. Finite Differences (Implicit and Explicit)
5. Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo Simulation (for American Option)
